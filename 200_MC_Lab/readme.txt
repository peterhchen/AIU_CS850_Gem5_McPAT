Q1. Why McPAT?
Ans: Get Power, Area, and Timing result for architectural design before Verilog Design.
Q1. What is McPAT-Calib?
Ans:
1.1 McPAT-Calib is PAT (Power, Area, Timing) framework for RISC-V Boom (Berkeley Out-Of-Order Machine). 
1.2 McPAT-Calib model the McPAT-7nm (improve from McPAT) for RISC-V BOOM Core. 
1.3 Currently, McPAT-Calib uses ML (Machine Learning) with mathematic/regression to construct PAT Model.
1.4  Current McPAT-Calib uses ML (Machine Learning) which is based on Math/Statistics Regression. 
1.5 McPAT-Calib can be improved from ML (Machine Learning)/Math/Statistics into DL (Deep Learning)/NN (Neural Network) to construct Power Model. 
1.5.2 The linear combination of Neurons can improve accuracy and avoid overfitting problem in high-order regression in ML (Machine Learning). 
Q2. What is difference of Gem5 and McPAT?
Ans:
2.1 Gem5 is focus on Timing in cycle accuracy.
2.2 McPAT is get the simulation result for Power, Area, and Timing.
Q3. How to use Gem5 and McPAT together?
Ans: Run Gem5 to get timing result and McPAT to get the complete power, area, and timing results.
