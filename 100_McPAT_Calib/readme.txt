1. Introduction: Before CPU/GPU Design, we do not have any verilog code. How do we know the PAT (Power, Area, and Timing/Performance)?
We use McPAT (Multi Core Power/Area/Timing)-7nm for Power Model and Machine Learning with Feature Select and XGBoost Regression
Here, we discuss the ML (Machine Learning). We also can use Deep Learning/Neural Network for better accuracy. 
2. Power Modeling Problem formulation: Static power and Dynamic Power
3. McPAT-Calib: McPAT-7nm power model and XGBoost Machine Learning  
4. Evaluation: Boom (Berkeley Out-Of-Order Machine) Configuration and Benchmarks
5. Conclusion
Why McPAT-Calib is good? 
5.1 McPAT-7nm is good power model.
5.2 Machine Learning: Feature selection, XGBoost regression
5.3 AL (Active Learning) Sampling: Select the diversity sample to reduce huge amount of sample.
